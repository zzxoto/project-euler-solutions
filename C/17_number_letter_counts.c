//Question:
//
//If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
//If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
//
//NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
//The use of 'and' when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

//@param r1, r2 inclusive range
u32 soln(u32 r1, u32 r2)
{
  return 0;
}

i32 main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  printf("%d\n", soln(1, 1000));
  return 0;
}
